# Core Test Policy

## Test Layer Model

Every CTest registration has exactly one execution tier and may add risk labels.
The tier determines the maximum timeout and the kind of behavior it proves:

| Tier | Purpose | Maximum timeout |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `unit` | A single Core Module behavior, isolated from I/O and hosts. | 10 seconds |
| `component` | A module boundary or capability collaboration. | 30 seconds |
| `contract` | A versioned contract, conformance rule, or build invariant. | 30 seconds |
| `host` | An Application Facade consumer or host boundary. | 120 seconds |
| `e2e` | The canonical assembled proof path. | 180 seconds |
| `stress` | A bounded reliability or load scenario. | 300 seconds |

Risk labels describe a cross-cutting concern without creating another tier. The
current labels are `persistence`, `audio`, `provider`, `assembly`, `abi`, and
`concurrency`.

## Test Selection Rule

Select the lowest tier that can exercise the changed behavior through its
public boundary. Promote a test only when the behavior depends on a real
cross-module, host, or assembled-product collaboration. Do not use an `e2e`
test to replace missing unit, component, or contract coverage.

## Coverage Thresholds

Changed Core Module behavior needs at least one automated test at its lowest
applicable tier. Changed contract parsing, serialization, or conformance rules
need a contract test for every supported and rejected case. A host or product
assembly change needs its focused host or end-to-end proof in addition to the
lower-tier coverage that owns its behavior. Coverage percentages are a review
signal, not a substitute for these behavior thresholds.

## Deterministic Seeds

Tests that use randomness must take an explicit seed and print it on failure.
The default seed is `0`; a different seed must be fixed in the test command or
fixture. Time, network access, and machine-local state are not random-seed
substitutes and must be controlled or injected.

## No-Retry Policy

An automated test runs once per requested command. A failure is evidence to
diagnose, not a reason to retry until it passes. A deliberate rerun after a
code or environment correction must be recorded as a new result.

## Proof-Scoped C ABI Concurrency Baseline

The C ABI stress suite verifies the behavior already approved and implemented
by Headless Core Proof Task 8:

- the live-engine registry is synchronized;
- operations on one live engine are serialized;
- different live engines may make progress independently;
- `free` racing with an in-flight call is safe because the call retains shared
  state;
- null, unknown, freed, double-freed, and ABA handles remain invalid and safe;
- opaque handle shells are retained for process lifetime to prevent address
  reuse; and
- one shell per successful create is an intentional Proof-stage memory
  tradeoff.

This is verification of the existing Proof implementation, not a new
cross-language product Contract. It does not promise ordering between
concurrent calls on one engine, and it does not promise that caller-owned
response strings may be transferred across threads. A future change to
tombstone lifetime or stable external threading semantics requires its own
approved design and C ABI version review.

## Evidence Boundaries

Automated tests provide reproducible evidence for the configured Core build.
They do not establish physical-device behavior, store sandbox acceptance,
release signing, deployment promotion, or production-service acceptance. Those
gates require their own device, release, or deployment evidence.
